Timer -> move to requestAnimationFrame()

Where to place the timer? it should replace the while loop.

How does it work?

Draw function <- stepper motors <- micro:bit

stepper motors <- pulse outputs <- micro:bit

2 outputs per motor  -> 1 direction pulse / 1 strength pulse

While {
    Draw
    stepper
    pulse
    
}

Ok so setup:

{
    object containing all necessary data, part of this will be the array of points or paths that are necessary
}

function draw() {
    A while loop that
    that takes the ncessary function as an argument and continues to run until it hits a point, then updates what direction it is going in.
}
